Hello there!

This is the first assignment I have coded for this course.

In this assignment, I have created a web page for a very primitive menu of a restaurant. It is completely based on HMTL and CSS without using any Bootstrap.

Purpose of this assignment was to learn how to create a responsive webpage without using Bootstrap's grid system. I have challenged myself to create this responsive page only
positioning and floating the elements.

I developed a sense of understanding regarding containers, rows, positioning and floating.
