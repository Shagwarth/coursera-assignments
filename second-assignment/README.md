Hello there!

This is the second assignment I have coded for this course.

In this assignment, I have created a web page for a very primitive menu of a restaurant. It is coded with HTML and CSS but this time I have used Bootstrap

Purpose of this assignment was to learn how to create a responsive webpage with navbar for mobile screens by using Bootstrap. I have challenged myself to read documentations
and get the navbar working.

I developed a sense of understanding Bootstrap in a beginner level.
